    description: "You have a strategy. Your teams have workflows. They are disconnected. Let's fix that. I spent 15 years scaling a global brand from startup to over a million units annually, reporting directly to the divisional CEO within a $1.6B group. My experience spans the entire commercial ecosystem: GTM, B2B, B2C, and B2E - from brand building, data management, marketing and sales leadership to partnerships, forecasting, and the retail front line. Rapid growth always reveals missed opportunity. But as part of an enterprise tiger team, I learned the real bottleneck isn't technology - it's adoption. So I built custom AI tools that teams and leaders actually used. You don't need a wishlist. You need your people free to do their best work. Let's find your bottleneck.",

  about: {
    title: "From Commercial Scale to AI Catalyst",
    bio: `Most strategies fail in translation. Not because they're wrong—because the people executing them are overwhelmed.

I spent 15 years scaling a global brand from startup to omnichannel, delivering over a million units annually in Australia and New Zealand, working across B2B, B2C, wholesale, marketing, and retail—culminating in a senior commercial role reporting directly to the divisional CEO of a $1.6B group. I learned the entire ecosystem not from a deck, but from doing it.

Here's what I learned: your bottleneck isn't technology. It's human capacity. Your teams are buried in process. Your tools don't talk to each other. And your strategy—no matter how sharp—can't land if your people are stretched too thin to execute it well.

So I started building AI tools that teams actually adopt. Custom systems trained in your brand's voice that reduce friction, embed quality, and free your people to think instead of react. Not platforms. Not dashboards. Tools designed around what your customer and your teams actually need, built through your marketing, sales, product, and operations to deliver it.

I'm the first person with Type 1 and part of the first team to ever complete the 4 Deserts Grand Slam—ultramarathons across Antarctica, the Atacama, the Gobi, and the Sahara. I don't quit when systems fail and quitting makes sense. I bring that same discipline to this work: endurance, precision, and an unreasonable commitment to making things actually work.

Let's build your strategy and capacity for what's next.`,
